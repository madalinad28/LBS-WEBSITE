### Overview of the dataset

There are no missing values according to the skim function. Nevertheless, we notice some duplicate values, for example "Nightmare on Elm Street" or "Alice in Wonderland". We have to be careful to look at more than just the title in identifying duplicates, as some movies could have the same name, but be released twice on different dates or have a different director.

```{r,Skim_data}
# Skim IMDB data
skim(movies)

```

### Movie count by genre, ranked in descending order Data Frame
    ```{r,count_of_movies}
    movies%>%
      count(sort = TRUE,genre)
    ```

### Average gross earnings and budget by genre Data Frame

    ```{r,avg_gross_budget}
    # Create table with the average gross earning and budget
    avg_genre = movies%>%
      group_by(genre) %>% 
      summarize(avg_earning = sum(gross)/count(genre),
                avg_budget = sum(budget)/count(genre)) # Create 2 columns to store the average earning and budget
    avg_genre%>% 
      mutate(return_on_budget = avg_earning/avg_budget) %>% # The return is just the earning/budget
      arrange(desc(return_on_budget))
    ```

### Top 15 directors of the highest gross revenue in the box office Data Frame

    ```{r,top_15}
    # Calculate summary statistics for top 15 directors 
    Top_directors = movies%>%
      group_by(director) %>% 
      summarise(sum_gross = sum(gross),
                mean_gross = mean(gross),
                median_gross = median(gross),
                SD_gross = sd(gross))
    # Choose the top 15 with highest gross earnings
    Top_directors%>%
      slice_max(sum_gross,n = 15)
    ```

### Ratings distribution by genre

    ```{r,rating}
    # Calculate summary statistics for ratings by genre
    Ratings_genre = movies%>%
      group_by(genre)%>%
      summarise(mean_ratings = mean(rating),
                min_rating = min(rating),
                max_rating = max(rating),
                median_rating = median(rating),
                SD_rating = sd(rating))
    Ratings_genre

    # Plot ratings by genre
    ggplot(movies,aes(x=rating)) +
      geom_density() +
      labs(title="There are few completely unpopular movies with a rating of less than 5",subtitle = "Density plot of movie ratings on IMDB",x = "Rating", y = "Density")+
      theme_bw()
    ```

## Movie Box Office Revenue analysis

### Are Facebook Likes of cast members a good predictor for how much a movie will make?

While there seems to be a minor correlation between the amount of cast facebook likes and the money a movie makes, the relationship is not strong enough to make it a good predictor of a movie's success.

```{r, gross_on_fblikes}
# Map revenue vs Facebook likes
movies%>%
ggplot(aes(x=cast_facebook_likes, y = gross)) +
  geom_point()+scale_x_log10()+geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title="Cast Facebook likes do not seem to be a reliable predictor of movie success",subtitle = "Scatterplot of number of cast facebook likes and movie gross revenue",x = "Number of Cast Facebook Likes", y = "Gross Revenue")+
  theme_bw()
```

### Is budget a good predictor of how much money a movie will make?

While a budget is surely not a guarantor of movie success , the fitted line has a positive slope and therefore implies that with rising budget comes rising gross revenue.

```{r, gross_on_budget}
 #Map revenue vs budget
movies%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=budget,y=gross))+
  geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title="A higher budget seems to positively affect movie gross revenue",subtitle = "Scatterplot of movie budget and movie gross revenue",x = "Budget", y = "Gross Revenue")+
  theme_bw()

```

### Are IMDB ratings a good predictor of how much a movie will make?

Generally, higher ratings indicates higher gross earnings for all genres for which we have a significant amount of data. However, we can also see that it is possible for movies to have a good rating while not making a lot of money. This most likely concern the likes of indie movies, that receive strong support but never make it into the pop culture.

There are some interesting anomalies in the data in the form of extreme values. Drama movies usually fall within the same range of gross revenues, however "Titanic" by James Cameron reports much higher values than the rest. Coincidentally, James Cameron is also the director for highest grossing movie in the data "Avatar". It is also noticeable that there are no observable outliers for genres like comedy or adventure, even though there are several movies of the genre in the data. Apparently these categories do not display the required parameters to polarize the nation.

```{r, gross_on_rating}
# Map revenue vs rating, faceted by genre
movies%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=rating, y = gross,color=genre))+
  geom_point()+facet_wrap(~genre)+
  labs(title="A higher rating seems to be correlated to higher gross revenues",subtitle = "Faceted scatterplot of IMDB rating and movie gross revenue",x = "IMDB Rating", y = "Gross Revenue")
```
